theory:

The N-Queens problem is a classical puzzle where the goal is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. It's a popular problem in combinatorial optimization and is often solved using backtracking, a recursive algorithmic technique.

Here's a high-level description of how you can approach solving the N-Queens problem using backtracking:

Initialize an empty N×N chessboard.

Start by placing the first queen in the first row, and try to place it in each column of that row one by one. For each column, check if it's safe to place the queen there without threatening any other queens already on the board. The "is_safe" function checks for safety by examining the rows, columns, and diagonals.

If you find a safe spot to place the queen in the first row, move on to the second row and repeat the process for the second queen. Continue this process for all rows, placing one queen in each row.

If you reach a point where you cannot place a queen in a row without violating the N-Queens constraints, backtrack to the previous row and try the next available column for that queen. If you've exhausted all columns and still can't find a solution, backtrack further to the previous queen until you find a safe spot or exhaust all possibilities.

Continue this process until you've placed all N queens on the board or determined that there is no solution.

If you've successfully placed all N queens on the board, you've found a valid solution. Record the placement of queens (e.g., using a list or a data structure) as one of the solutions.

Keep exploring other possibilities by backtracking until you've examined all possible placements of queens.

Collect all valid solutions to the N-Queens problem.

It's important to note that the N-Queens problem may have multiple solutions, and backtracking is an effective way to systematically explore these possibilities while avoiding invalid placements of queens.
